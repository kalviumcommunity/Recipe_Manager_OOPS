# Project Idea :

The project idea is to build a Recipe Manager Application. This system will allow users to manage recipes, including their names, ingredients, instructions, and other relevant details.

The Recipe Manager Application is a tool that allows users to create, store, and organize their collection of recipes. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage recipes, making it easy to find, edit, and share them. Users can input recipe details, including the recipe name, ingredients, quantities, instructions, and other relevant information. The application also allows users to categorize recipes, search for specific recipes, and generate shopping lists based on selected recipes.
